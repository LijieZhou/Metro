"""
Extract the Golden Four courses for each CCSF student
and create a Saleforce DataLoader ready CSV file.

How to USE:

STEP 1:

    Copy this script into a folder containing only the CSV file version of the
    CCSF Banner query.

STEP 2:
    Windows: Double click this file

    OSX/Linux: Change directory to the folder and run
    'python golden_four.py'


NOTES:
    If there are no CSV files in the folder this will do nothing, but will
    yell at you a bit about that.
    If there is more than one CSV file it will pick the first one it finds that
    doesn't have the same name as args.outfile (which is defaulted to
    "00-CCSF_Golden_Four.csv").
    You may specify the name of the input file and/or the name of the output
    file if you run from terminal.

For running from terminal help:
    Run 'python golden_four.py -help'
